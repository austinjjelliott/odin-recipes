# odin-recipes
This is the first GitHub repository since setting up the account and doing our test run 
It was made on GitHub, imported to local device using the terminal, (this file was opened by the terminal), and now it will be edited by VSCode.
It will be an HTML website consisting of recipes 
Wish me luck ...
